# LSE: Law of Superposed Emergence (I_LSE)

LSE is a meta-gate: emergence requires **Intent × Temporal × Physical** to be simultaneously satisfied.

I_LSE = 0 iff:
- gate results (i_90=0 AND i_91=0)
- infrastructure support OK (budget + verifier trust)

Else: I_LSE = +∞ → Fail-Closed

Support clauses (reference):
- energy_budget_ok must be true
- verifier_consensus_hash must be non-empty / non-null
